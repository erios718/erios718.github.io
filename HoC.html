	<center><p>Cyberattacks have a rich history because they have been around since 1988. Over the years the attacks have evolved and caused tons of havoc for many users. Here are highlights of some major cyberattacks:</p>

<h2><p2 style="color:white"><u>The Morris Worm:</p2></u></h2>
	<p>It is one of the first network worms distributed over the Internet. It caused Denial of Service(DoS) for many users, this ment that users were unable to connect to the internet. It was written by a graduate student at Cornell University and was launched on November 2, 1988 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The damage from the Morris worm was estimated at about $ 96.5 million.</p><br>

<h2><p2 style="color:white"><u>Chernobyl Virus:</p2></u></h2>
	<p>The Chernobyl virus is a computer virus with the ability to destroy all computer data when an infected file is executed. Since many files are executed during computer use, the virus is able to spread quickly and infect many files. The Chernobyl virus is the first virus known to have the power to damage computer hardware. The virus first appeared in June 1998.</p><br>

<h2><p2 style="color:white"><u>Melissa virus:</p2></u></h2>
	<p>The Melissa virus became the first malicious code to spread via email, it was first sent in March 1999. The virus infected many letters which lead to the processing of emails to slow down significantly. The damage of the Melissa virus was estimated at $80 million.</p><br>

<h2><p2 style="color:white"><u>Mafiaboy virus:</p2></u></h2>
	<p>The Mafiaboy virus was one of the first full-scale DDoS(Distributed Denial of Service) attack via the Internet servers of large companies, which occurred in 2000. This prevented users from connecting with the affected companies. Several companies that were attacked were Yahoo, FIFA, Amazon, Dell, eBay and CNN. The damage of the Mafiaboy virus amounted to approximately $1.2 billion.</p><br>


<h2><p2 style="color:white"><u>Cabir:</p2></u></h2>
	<p>Cabir, the first mobile virus, is a worm that infected mobile phones that supported Bluetooth in 2004. If the worm is activated, it writes Caribe on the screen, and will become active each time the phone is turned on. The virus was disguised as a program. The infection spreads very quickly, usually before a user can disable Bluetooth.
